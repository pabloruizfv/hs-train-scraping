# hs-train-scraping

A couple of web scraping programs, running on Python, using selenium and other libraries.

These programs fill in the menus at AVLO and OUIGO websites with some provided information in order to browse, parse and save the existing train services times and prices for a specific set of origins and destinations and dates.

Additionaly, a simple round trip finder script that works with the output of the scraping programs has been added.

In order to understand the full use case, visit my portfolio site at: (https://pabloruizfv.wordpress.com/high_speed_train_analysis/)
